// discovery reads a package's Module.Dir to reach a DEPENDENCY's sources in the
// module cache, and without it that field is nil and the whole capability
// degrades silently to whatever happens to sit in the local tree. NeedDeps and
// NeedImports are what make an imported package's types resolvable rather than
// opaque. NeedSyntax and NeedTypesInfo are what let a consumer map a Go
// expression back to a type, which is what typing a flow node's Go span needs.

// PACKAGE LOADING IS THE EXPENSIVE OPERATION IN THIS WHOLE TOOLCHAIN — seconds,
// not microseconds. Load is therefore called ONCE per generation run, over every
// package together; never once per node, once per file or once per type. A
// caller that loads per unit of work turns a one-off cost into a per-unit one
// and will feel it immediately at interactive speeds.
//
// THE CACHE LIFETIME IS THE CALLER'S, because this module holds no
// process-global cache. A long-lived consumer such as a language server keeps
// its own *Packages for as long as it is valid and calls Load again when go.mod
// changes; a one-shot generator loads once and drops the result when it exits.
//
// IT REFUSES RATHER THAN RETURNS AN EMPTY LOAD. An empty pattern set, a
// directory the toolchain cannot load, and a pattern set matching no package at
// all are each an error naming what could not be done. Nothing here hands back a
// usable-looking zero value beside a nil error.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. A flow whose declaration carries no signature is not
// typed by this module — not here and not by any surface it exposes. Deciding
// what such a flow carries is inference over the flow graph, which belongs to
// the analysis layer ABOVE this module; the result reaches a consumer through
// the caller sitting above both, never through this module reaching sideways.

// Resolve turns a Go type SPELLING — the text a flow signature header carries —
// into the type it denotes inside the named package.
//
// THIS IS THE DEEPENING THE FLOW ANALYZERS COULD NOT DO. Comparing signatures as
// text equates nothing that is spelled two ways, and distinguishes nothing that
// is spelled one way and means two things. Evaluating the spelling in the
// package's OWN scope is what makes an alias, a dot-qualified name and a
// locally-renamed import resolve exactly as they would inside that package.
//
// THE SPELLING IS EVALUATED IN A FILE'S SCOPE, NOT THE PACKAGE'S, and that is a
// measured requirement rather than a preference. An import is declared in the
// FILE scope, so at the package scope's own position an import-qualified
// spelling resolves to nothing at all: evaluating "gob.GobEncoder" there reports
// `undefined: gob` even in a package whose files import encoding/gob. Since a
// flow signature header routinely names a type through its package qualifier,
// resolution walks EVERY file of the package, in filename order.
//
// A SPELLING ITS FILES DISAGREE ABOUT IS REFUSED, NOT DECIDED. Imports are
// per-file, so one alias can name two packages in two files of the same package
// — and since, say, encoding/gob and encoding/json both export Encoder, the
// spelling `codec.Encoder` can denote two different types in one package.
// Answering with the first file to resolve it would be deterministic and still
// wrong: it hands the caller one candidate and never discloses that another
// existed. The walk therefore continues past its first hit and refuses when two
// files resolve the spelling to types that are not identical, naming both
// candidates and the files they came from. Files that AGREE are not a
// disagreement, and resolution answers normally.
//
// EVERY REFUSAL NAMES ITS SUBJECT, and none has a fallback. A package that was
// never loaded is an error naming the path; a spelling that does not resolve is
// an error naming the spelling and the package it was resolved against; an
// ambiguous one names what it could not choose between. This function never
// hands back an invalid type beside a nil error — a caller cannot tell that
// shape from a real answer, which is exactly what makes it a defect rather than
// a convenience.
