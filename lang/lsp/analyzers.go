// at runtime — the starkest being typeflow's, which states outright that it is
// not type checking and that its silence is not agreement. Shortening the
// payload would delete the very thing the field exists to carry. THE COUNT IS
// NOT STATED HERE, deliberately: the mandated set is the analysis module's and
// grows with it, and the numeral that used to stand here went stale without
// reddening anything. That module's own gate is where the population is pinned.
