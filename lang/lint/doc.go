// Package lint is the batch face of the flow analysis core: it resolves path
// arguments to parsed sources, runs the registered analyzers over them, and
// renders the result for a person or for a machine.
//
// IT REIMPLEMENTS NO ANALYSIS. Every diagnostic this package emits was minted by
// lang/analysis — by an analyzer through analysis.Run, or by
// analysis.ParseDiagnostics out of a parse failure. This package supplies a
// threshold comparison, a merge and two renderers, and nothing else. A rule that
// belongs to the language belongs in the analysis core, where the editor and the
// batch tool both reach it.
//
// IT DOES NOT CLAIM MORE THAN THE ANALYZERS DO. Six of the thirteen registered
// analyzers state a limit in their own Doc, and a clean run is bounded by every
// one of them: typeflow compares declared spellings and IS NOT TYPE CHECKING,
// resolving nothing through go/types; state's bare-type check is a denylist of
// two retired spellings rather than a proof about the rest; switches mandates an
// else precisely because v1 cannot prove a switch is covered; resolve ships no
// unimported-qualifier check; signature says nothing about a use it cannot
// resolve; and errorrouting's unhandled-failure finding reports a shape that is
// legal and may well be deliberate. That is why a clean run reports that no
// registered rule fired rather than that no problems exist, and why the -rules
// listing prints each analyzer's own Doc verbatim instead of summarizing it.
//
// There is no rule selection, no configuration file and no suppression syntax.
// Each is a lever for making a finding disappear without fixing it. The one knob
// is the fail threshold, and it can only be made stricter than its default.
