// Load resolves paths to parsed sources, refusing any input it cannot fill.
//
// A path naming a file is taken as that file whatever its extension, so the
// operator lints what the operator named. A path naming a directory is walked
// RECURSIVELY and every Extension file under it is taken — no vendor rule and no
// ignore file, because a silent exclusion is how a file stops being checked
// without anyone deciding it should.
//
// THE THREE REFUSALS ARE THE POINT. No paths, a path that cannot be stat-ed, and
// a non-empty path set holding no flow sources are all errors. A linter handed an
// input set it could not fill would otherwise answer "clean" to every question it
// was never asked, and that vacuous green is indistinguishable at the exit status
// from a real one.
//
// Arguments are the operator's own input here — a person or a CI job runs this
// against paths its own configuration names — so they are validated against what
// they are allowed to be and REJECTED rather than coerced. They are deliberately
// NOT confined by os.Root: a linter is pointed at arbitrary trees by its
// operator, and a root would break `flowlint ../other/tree`, which is a primary
// use.
//
// The walk is SERIAL, which is a measurement rather than a preference: an
// thirteen-analyzer pass over a strawman costs tens of microseconds against a
// parse an order of magnitude larger, so file I/O and parsing dominate and both
// are per-file and cheap. A worker pool would spend more on coordination than it
// saves.
