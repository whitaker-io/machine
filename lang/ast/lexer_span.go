//
// SEVEN ARE THE CLAUSE KEYWORDS, which end a span because a clause follows it.

// value and the grammar's trailing `[ Else ]` would order nothing. Stopping here
// makes an else arm unmatchable as an Arm, which is what makes else-last a rule
// the notation expresses rather than one only the parser knows. Nothing valid is
// lost: a Go EXPRESSION never begins with `else`, and `else` inside a func body
// is untouched because that body is scanned by the brace-balanced func span,
