// USAGE
//
//	flowc -in ./flows -out ./flows -package generated -qualifier acme
//
// It discovers .flow files by extension, the way the Go toolchain discovers .go
// files: nothing marks a directory as flow-bearing, because a marker is one more
// thing to forget and its absence would silently generate nothing.
//
// THE FIFTH FLAG IS -pkgpath, AND ITS DEFAULT IS EMPTY ON PURPOSE. An empty value
// selects the derivation — the import path of the output directory, read from the
// nearest enclosing go.mod — so the ordinary invocation above needs no new
// knowledge. Pass it only for the case the derivation cannot serve: generating
// into a directory whose enclosing module is not the one the generated code will
// be compiled in.
//
// GENERATED CODE IS A BUILD ARTIFACT. Commit .flow sources, not the .go this
// writes; the repository's .gitignore excludes the pattern. Regeneration is
// always WHOLE — every previously generated file is removed before the new set is
// put in place — so deleting a .flow leaves no orphaned .go behind to go on
// compiling forever.
//
// NOTHING IS WRITTEN UNTIL EVERYTHING EMITS. Files are staged and renamed into
// place only after the whole run succeeds, so a failure partway through cannot
// leave a directory that is neither the old program nor the new one.
//
// WHAT REFUSES AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED. Before anything is written, flowc runs
// every analyzer the language has — the thirteen registered ones plus type
// inference and the serialization derivation, which are constructed because they
// need a loaded package set. A finding at analysis.SeverityError REFUSES the run:
// nothing is written and the exit status is non-zero. Everything below that line
// is printed to STDERR and the run CONTINUES, because the language calls a
// warning "suspicious but not provably wrong" and a hint "an observation an
// author may reasonably ignore" — refusing on those would refuse legal programs,
// and printing nothing would hide findings the analyzers already paid to compute.
// So a run that printed findings and still wrote files is behaving as designed.
//
// THE HOST OWNS THE JOURNAL. A flow containing a checkpoint clause needs a
// recovery journal, and generated code does not build one: the host constructs
// its Machine and passes machine.OptionJournal. Every generated Wire function
// returns error uniformly, whether or not its flow checkpoints, so a call site
// never depends on a property of the .flow source it cannot see. For a flow that
// DOES checkpoint, Wire checks for a journal BEFORE declaring any node and
// returns an error naming the flow and the option, leaving the machine untouched.
// The RUNTIME's own refusal is a different one and arrives later: a checkpointed
// node declared on a journal-less machine records a declaration error that Start
// returns, and Wire returns nothing on the runtime's behalf.
