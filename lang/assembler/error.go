// Diagnostic is one positioned problem found while assembling.
//
// IT CARRIES THREE FIELDS AND NO MORE, matching ast.Diagnostic exactly: no
// severity and no rule code. Everything this package reports is a refusal, so a
// severity would have one value at every site and a code would be a second
// naming scheme for the message already there.
//
// The positions are ast.Position values taken from the offending statement, so a
// caller renders a graph refusal and a parse refusal through the same path. Col
// counts BYTES rather than runes, which is what lets an editor map an offset
// without re-scanning the line.
//
// PATH IS EMPTY FOR A REFUSAL THIS PACKAGE RAISED, and non-empty for one that
// crossed in from somewhere else. The earlier reading — that this type needs no
// Path because "this package is handed one flow's statements at a time and the
// driver knows the file" — was true of this package's own refusals and is not
// true of an analysis finding, which crosses a whole run of files. Two files'
// parsed trees both start at offset zero, so a position alone cannot name one.
type Diagnostic struct {
	Pos     ast.Position
	End     ast.Position
	Message string
	// Path is the file the diagnostic is about, EMPTY when this package raised
	// it and the caller's own file name is the right answer.
	Path string
	// Foreign marks a diagnostic about a file the RUN NEVER PARSED — hand-written
	// consumer Go an analysis read through the loaded package set rather than a
	// .flow source this package was handed. It rides along because the two are
	// rendered differently: a caller knows the file of a refusal it handed in and
	// does not know this one, so Error names it.
	Foreign bool
}

// Error carries every problem found in one assembly run, together with whatever
// files were emitted in spite of them.
//
// IT IS THE ONLY EXPORTED ERROR TYPE IN THIS PACKAGE, and that is the same
// deliberate rule lang/ast follows. A graph problem, a lowering refusal and an
// emission failure all arrive here as Diagnostics on one value, so a caller
// never type-switches to find out which stage failed — an unresolvable from-name
// and a statement shape with no lowering reach an editor through exactly the
// same channel.
//
// PARTIAL IS NOT AN APOLOGY. A run over several flows that refuses one of them
// still generated the others, and handing them back lets a driver report every
// problem in the run rather than stopping at the first. It is the caller's
// decision whether a partial result is usable; this package's own driver
// declines to write any of it, so a refusal never leaves a half-regenerated
// output directory.

	Diagnostics []Diagnostic
	Partial     []Generated
}

// Error renders the first diagnostic's position and message, plus how many
// problems were found in total.
//
// A FOREIGN DIAGNOSTIC RENDERS ITS FILE AND THE REST DO NOT, which is the same
// rule Path itself carries. A refusal about one of the caller's own .flow sources
// is rendered by a caller that knows which file it handed in; a refusal about
// hand-written Go the run merely loaded names a file the caller never mentioned,
// and a bare line and column there point at nothing.
