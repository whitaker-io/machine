// module reads them, so a change to either side that breaks the other surfaces
// here rather than at integration time. THE CORPUS IS CLOSED — lang/ast's own
// suite asserts set equality against a pinned count of four, so a fifth file
// added there reds that suite on two axes. This module's own fixtures live under
// lang/analysis/testdata.

// TestAnalyzerDocsCarryTheirDisclosures gates the six truthfulness statements

// Each exists to stop a consumer over-reading a check's SILENCE as a proof:
// typeflow's silence is not a type-safety proof, state's bare-type check is a
// two-name denylist rather than validation, resolve ships no unimported-
// qualifier check, switches cannot prove coverage in v1, errorrouting's
// well-formedness leg is not the enforcement, and flowgraph's send modeling is
// one of two defensible readings. Those sentences change nothing observable when
// dropped, so nothing but a gate catches their omission.
//
// THE HOME IS Analyzer.Doc rather than a source comment, because Doc is what a
// downstream consumer can read AT RUNTIME — a Go comment is invisible to the LSP
// and the linter — and because it is assertable over All() regardless of whether
// the analyzer variables are exported.
