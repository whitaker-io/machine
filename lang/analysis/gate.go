// Boundaries is every flow's BINDABLE OUTPUT NAMES, keyed by flow.
//
// It is the signature analyzer's own answer lifted out of a run rather than a
// second derivation: the names a `use` may bind are the DECLARED outputs when the
// flow has a header and everything its body produces when it does not, and
// bindableNames is where that rule lives.

//
// ABSENCE IS THE FALSE SECOND RESULT, never an empty slice. A flow nobody
// exported a boundary for and a flow whose boundary is genuinely empty are
// different facts, and a caller that cannot tell them apart generates against an
// absent one as though it were empty — which is the silence this whole seam
// exists to remove. InferredTypes.Name reports absence the same way.

// Gate runs EVERY analyzer this module has over srcs, in one driver run, and

//
// SIXTEEN ANALYZERS, ONE WALK. The thirteen All() registers plus the three that
// are constructed because they need a caller-supplied package set — type
// inference, the serialization derivation and the consumer-Go host-reach check,
// none of which is registered and none of which this function registers. Running
// the sets separately would walk the sources several times over and derive the
// symbol table each time; naming them all in one capture's Requires lets the
// driver's own topological order do it once.
//
// THIS IS THE SEAM BuildGuidance ESTABLISHED AND BuildInferredTypes FOLLOWED: an
// anonymous capture analyzer names what it wants, runs through the REAL driver,
// and lifts the built values out of Pass.ResultOf, so the prerequisite ordering
// stays the driver's rather than becoming a second copy of it. The capture is
// placed last by that same order, which is what lets it read every result.
//
// A NIL PACKAGE SET IS REFUSED, wrapping the shared errNoPackages sentinel so
// errors.Is holds for a caller, on the same terms as BuildInferredTypes. A run
// that produces no inferred table is an ERROR rather than an empty result beside
// a nil error, because a caller cannot tell those two apart.
//
// PERF SHAPE, from the driver's own measurement: a full structural walk costs
// 22ns against a 12.278µs parse, so sixteen analyzers cost a few percent of the
// parse that precedes them. Serial, one pass, no pool. THE HOST-REACH CHECK IS
// THE ONE THAT DOES NOT WALK FLOW TREES: it walks the Go the run already loaded,
// which costs nothing to load and is bounded by the ROOT packages rather than by
// the index.
