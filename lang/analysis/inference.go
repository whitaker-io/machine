// environment is the pair of REAL SCOPES one flow file's spellings are evaluated
// in: the package the generated code joins, and the flow file's own import set.
//
// THE FIRST SCOPE IS THE ORDINARY SHAPE. A .flow's commonest reference is a BARE
// name for a Go func declared beside it, and that func lives in the package the
// generated file joins. Nothing but that package's own scope holds it, which is
// why evaluating only against the file's imports reported every such reference
// undefined.
//
// THE SECOND SCOPE SOLVES A DIFFERENT PROBLEM, and it is why both are kept: a
// flow file's QUALIFIED reference must be evaluated under THAT FILE'S imports,
// and no Go package with that import set exists anywhere on disk. Resolving
// `stripe.IsPayment` against the package that DECLARES stripe refuses with
// `undefined: stripe`, because inside its own package a package name is not in
// scope. The route that works is a synthetic package holding one types.PkgName
// per import the flow file declared. A .flow may also import a module the Go
// package beside it does not, so this is a DIFFERENT REAL SCOPE rather than a
// weaker one.
//
// THERE IS NO THIRD, EMPTY SCOPE. When neither holds the name the reference is
// refused naming BOTH attempts, rather than falling back to a scope that can only
// answer for the universe.
//
// One environment is built per FILE rather than per node: construction costs
// ~692ns against a ~1.7µs simple evaluation, and the memo makes repeated
// spellings free — the corpus repeats them heavily.
