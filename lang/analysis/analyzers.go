package analysis

// The module's analyzers are registered here, in one place and in dependency
// order, rather than from an init function in each analyzer's own file.
//
// Two reasons. All() reports registration order, and a per-file init would make
// that order the compiler's file ordering — deterministic, but arbitrary and
// invisible at the call site. And the set a consumer gets from All() is a fact
// about this module worth reading in one place: an analyzer that exists but was
// never registered is unreachable through the public seam, and that is far
// easier to notice as a missing line here than as a missing init elsewhere.
