// The analysis budget, structured on lang/ast's reparse budget so the two are
// read together.
//
// THE BUDGET IS ANCHORED ON MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN INVENTION. One full
// structural walk of payments.flow costs about 22 nanoseconds and visits 46
// elements, while a parse plus one walk costs about 12 microseconds — the parse
// dominates by roughly 500x. Thirteen analyzers each doing one walk therefore land
// the whole pass in the same tens-of-microseconds band as the parse it follows,
// leaving the one-millisecond editor budget with well over an order of magnitude
// of headroom.
//
// If the measured figure ever comes in above about 100 microseconds, that is a
// signal an analyzer has gone quadratic and should be investigated. It is NOT a
// signal to raise the budget.

// TestFullAnalysisBudget measures a parse plus the full registered analyzer set
// over the payments strawman, and prints the figure whether it passes or fails,
// so the number lives in the run rather than only in a plan.
//
// NOTE ON THE TEST CACHE: this is the one measurement in this package whose
// validity depends on the run being fresh. A cached PASS is a valid pass of the
// assertion but it re-measures nothing, so a figure in the log from a cached run
// is the figure from whenever it last actually ran. That is stated here rather
// than defended with a cache-defeating flag, which would cost every unrelated run
// for no information — the same call lang/ast made.
