`Machine` is a library for creating data workflows. These workflows can be either very concise or quite complex, even allowing for cycles for flows that need retry or self healing mechanisms.



------

### **Installation**

Add the primary library to your project
```bash
  go get github.com/whitaker-io/machine/v2
```

------

The main function types are:

```golang
// Applicative is a function that is applied to payload and used for transformations
type Applicative[T any] func(d T) T

// Test is a function used in composition of And/Or operations and used to
// filter results down different branches with transformations
type Test[T any] func(d T) (T, error)

// Filter is a function that can be used to filter the payload.
type Filter[T any] func(d T) bool

```

These are used in the `Builder` type provided by the `Stream` type:


```golang
// Stream is a representation of a data stream and its associated logic.
//
// The Builder method is the entrypoint into creating the data processing flow.
// All branches of the Stream are required to end in an OutputTo call.
type Stream[T any] interface {
	Start(ctx context.Context, input chan T) error
	Builder() Builder[T]
}

// Builder is the interface provided for creating a data processing stream.
type Builder[T any] interface {
	Then(a Applicative[T]) Builder[T]
	Or(x ...Test[T]) (Builder[T], Builder[T])
	And(x ...Test[T]) (Builder[T], Builder[T])
	Filter(f Filter[T]) (Builder[T], Builder[T])
	Duplicate() (Builder[T], Builder[T])
	Loop(x Filter[T]) (loop, out Builder[T])
	Drop()
	Distribute(Edge[T]) Builder[T]
	OutputTo(x chan T)
}
```

`Distribute` is a special method used for fan-out operations. It takes an instance of `Edge[T]` and can be used most typically to distribute work via a Pub/Sub. The `Edge[T]` interface is as follows:

```golang
// Edge is an interface that is used for transferring data between vertices
type Edge[T any] interface {
	ReceiveOn(ctx context.Context, channel chan T)
	Send(payload T)
}
```

The `Send` method is used for data leaving the associated vertex and the `ReceiveOn` method is used by the following vertex to receive data. The `context.Context` used is the same as the one used to start the `Stream`.
